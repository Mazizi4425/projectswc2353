            <h2>Step 1: Pre-Arrival</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Students must settle the required advance payment (registration and accommodation) and ensure the arrival date is within the timeline set by the International Student Office.</li>
                <li>Kindly seek advice from the International Student Office if students are unable to make travel arrangements within the timeline set by the International Office prior to flight confirmation to avoid any additional charges.</li>
                <li>Students must email the Airport Arrival Form seven (7) days before arrival with the proof of flight ticket.</li>
                <li>Students are reminded that the airport Immigration MAY NOT release students without a UPTM representative present. Therefore, Airport Arrival notification is important.</li>
                <li>UPTM will not bear any responsibility if the above instructions are not adhered to by the students.</li>
            </ul>
		
			
		
			<h2>Step 2:&nbsp;Arrival</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Kindly proceed to the Student Waiting Area upon arrival as the Malaysian Immigration Department requires higher education institution staff to release the student from the airport / entry point&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Students are reminded that the airport Immigration MAY NOT release students without a UPTM representative present.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Students will be sent to the UPTM Residence until the medical check-up status is updated.&nbsp;</li>
				
				
				
<h2>Step 3:&nbsp;Post-Arrival</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Students must report to the International Student Office on the next business day for a medical check-up arrangement.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>The International Student Office staff will transport students to the designated clinic for a medical check-up.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>The International Student Office will contact students for registration once the medical check-up status is updated in the EMGS portal.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Students must bring along their original transcript and original visa approval letter for registration.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Students with IELTS/TOEFL may proceed with their registered programme and those without IELTS/TOEFL are required to register English Preparatory Programme and need to fulfil the requirement score within 2 years.&nbsp;</li>
		       	<li>Students are advised to collect the Student Confirmation Letter from International Office to open a bank account upon registration.&nbsp;</li>
	            <li>Students are required to submit their passports immediately for Student Sticker endorsement for student pass sticker issuance and will return the passport to the student upon completion.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>Students are prohibited from travelling during passport submission.&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Failure to hand-in their passports for endorsement means students have overstayed and might be classified as illegal immigrants by the Malaysian Immigration Department.&nbsp;</li>
